        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>There are so many things I love do outside school that go beyond my passion in compsci,
            so here are a few of my favorites. ðŸ¤— </p>
        <article>
            <h3>Creative Activities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Viola:</u> I love playing the viola, and have been since 4th grade. For me personally, I prefer
                    playing in an <em>orchestra</em>,
                    especially alongside my friends. One of the <strong>best</strong> feelings ever is when a piece
                    finally
                    comes together, and all the notes harmonize to create a beautiful melody.</li>
                <li><u>Diamond Art:</u> Diamond art is created by sticking small stones together to create an intricate
                    image. Although
                    very <em>tedious</em>, the final results are <em>breathtaking</em> and is
                    definatly worth it. During 7th grade, I actually created up to 15 pieces and sold them at my
                    school's marketplace.</li>
                <li><u>Clay Bead Bracelets: </u>More recently, i've picked up making beaded bracelets. It fun and simple
                    to do. You can make so many fun designs and create <em>loads</em> of different combinations.
                    They're also super cute to wear as an everyday accessory.
                </li>
