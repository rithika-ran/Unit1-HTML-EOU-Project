        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>There are so many things I love do outside school that go beyond my passion in Compsci,
            so here are a few of my favorites. ðŸ¤— </p>
        <article>
            <h3>Some Activities ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ»</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Viola:</u> I love playing the viola, and have been since 4th grade. For me personally, I prefer
                    playing in an <em>orchestra</em>,
                    especially alongside my friends. One of the <strong>best</strong> feelings ever is when a piece
                    finally
                    comes together, and all the notes harmonize to create a beautiful melody.</li>
                <li><u>Diamond Art:</u> Diamond art is created by sticking small stones together to create an intricate
                    image. Although
                    very <em>tedious</em>, the final results are <em>breathtaking</em> and is
                    definatly worth it. During 7th grade, I actually created up to 15 pieces and sold them at my
                    school's marketplace.</li>
                <li><u>Clay Bead Bracelets: </u>More recently, i've picked up making beaded bracelets. It fun and simple
                    to do. You can make so many fun designs and create <em>loads</em> of different combinations.
                    They're also super cute to wear as an everyday accessory.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Books ðŸ“š</h3>
            <p>I love reading, its like an escape from reality. My favorite genres are
                fantasy and actions books. But I also do love some mystery and suspence. Here are some of my favorite
                books</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Keepers of the Lost Cities series</li>
                <li>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</li>
                <li>Heroes of Olympus</li>
                <li>The Maid</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Movies and Shows ðŸ“º</h3>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching lots of different movies and shows.
                However, I do prefer shows since their plots are written to be more indepth. I can never decide on
                a favorite though, so I though i'd list a couple of my favorite genres. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fantasy</li>
                <li>Mystery</li>
                <li>Action</li>
                <li>Comedy</li>
                <li>Adventure</li>
                <li>Animations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How All my Interests Connect</h3>
            <p>Although random, my interests help my creativity flow, fueling new ideas and interests.
                I believe having a combination of interests gives me further insight on how to be a problem solver. </p>
