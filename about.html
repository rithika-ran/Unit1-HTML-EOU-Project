            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>Hey there, I'm a freshman at Bergen Tech Teterboro, majoring in the Computer Science program.
                I've always been curious about how tech we use in everyday life <em>actually</em> works,
                which was what sparked my interest to try out this great program; and its safe to say I don't regret a
                thing. </p>
            <p>Outside of school, some of my favorite things to do are spend time with family
                and friends, watch movies and shows, and do fun activies like crafts.</p>
            <p>I'm <b>super</b> excited to learn all these new skills and languages as go through my high school
                journey!
                Hopefully, I can pursue this passion and apply it to my future career too.
            <p>
